    <h1>Privacy Policy – Bible Trivia Game</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>This privacy policy describes how the Bible Trivia Game app (“we”, “the app”) handles your information. We do not sell your data. We collect only what is needed for gameplay and the global leaderboard.</p>

    <h2>1. Information we collect and use</h2>

    <p><strong>Information you provide</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Leaderboard username</strong> – A name you choose, used only for the in-app global leaderboard. It is unique across players and cannot be changed after you complete your first game.</li>
        <li><strong>Player name (multiplayer)</strong> – Used only during a multiplayer game session so other players in that game can see who is playing. It is not used on the global leaderboard unless you set the same (or different) leaderboard username.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Information stored on your device</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Game settings (e.g. number of questions, time per question, difficulty), your leaderboard username, and recent game data so we can avoid repeating the same questions. This stays on your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Information we store on our servers (Firebase)</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Global leaderboard:</strong> Your chosen leaderboard username, a device identifier (see below), and your cumulative score so we can show the leaderboard and let you reclaim your username on the same device.</li>
        <li><strong>Multiplayer games:</strong> For each game session (identified by a PIN), we store game setup, player names and scores for that game, and when players answered (timestamps only, not your answers). This is needed so everyone in the same game stays in sync.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Device identifier</h2>
    <p>We use your device’s ID only to link your leaderboard username to your device. That way, if you reinstall the app on the same device, you can keep using the same username. We do not use this identifier for advertising or tracking across other apps.</p>

    <h2>3. What we do not collect</h2>
    <p>We do not collect your email address, phone number, or location. The app does not use advertising or in-app analytics. We do not sell or share your data with third parties for marketing.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-party services</h2>
    <p>The app uses Google Firebase (Realtime Database) for the leaderboard, multiplayer sync, and question updates. Data you provide (e.g. username, scores) is stored there. Google’s privacy policy applies to Firebase: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>. When you use the app, Google may also collect some technical and usage data as part of providing Firebase; we do not control that collection.</p>

    <h2>5. Data retention and deletion</h2>
    <p>Leaderboard and multiplayer game data is stored on our servers for as long as we offer the service. If you want your leaderboard entry removed, contact us (see below). Multiplayer game data is tied to a game PIN and is not linked to a long-term account.</p>

    <h2>6. Security</h2>
    <p>We use HTTPS for all network communication. Your data is stored in app-private storage on your device and in Firebase with access limited to what the app needs to function.</p>

    <h2>7. Children</h2>
    <p>The app can be played by people of all ages and is not directed specifically at children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided information through the app, please contact us and we will work to remove it.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date at the top will be revised when we do. Continued use of the app after changes means you accept the updated policy.</p>

    <h2>9. Contact</h2>
    <p>For privacy-related questions or to request removal of your leaderboard data, contact us at: <strong>info@phronesis.com.au</strong>.</p>

    <p>Thank you for playing Bible Trivia Game.</p>
